  ### Emoji

  Emoji are fun :sparkles:, and they can be silly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but they can also be an important communication tool when working with remote teams âœ…. Tone doesn't come across as clearly when reading text as it comes speaking face to face, and emojis can be helpful in conveying context and emotions. :heart:

  Emoji are best used as additive extras, not replacements for text. With images, descriptive text makes it clearer for screen readers, but screen readers aren't guaranteed to convey the intent of an emoji. Make sure your meaning is clear in text, so emoji will help instead of causing more confusion.

  Here are some examples of popular emojis in markdown.

  | What you see | What you type |
  | ---------- | ------------ |
  | :heart:    | `:heart:`    |
  | :+1:       | `:+1:`       |
  | :smile:    | `:smile:`    |
  | :sparkles: | `:sparkles:` |
  | :tada:     | `:tada:`     |
